gelf4j is set out to be an easy to use log4j appender to log to graylog2 via GELF messages.

---

Build with gradle via `gradle build` from the root directory

---

Deploy by placing the gelf4j.jar file in your class path.
If you don't have Groovy 1.7.6 already in your deployment, also place the groovy-all-1.7.6.jar in your classpath.
Of course you need log4j as well. gelf4j is built against version 1.2.16.

In a future release I hope to bundle this all up in a pom or so for easier distribution.

---

Configure the log4j appender by setting the appender class as usual and maintaining these additional configurations for the appender:
- graylogServerHost: the host name of your graylog server. Maintained as String. Defaults to localhost.
- graylogServerPort: the port of your graylog server. Maintained as Integer. Defaults to 12201.
- includeLocationInformation: determines if the logger will include location information (where a log occurred in which file file). Maintained as boolean. Defaults to false.

See http://www.graylog2.org/ and http://www.graylog2.org/about/gelf for details on what that is.

---

Notes:
- The 'short_message' of the GELF messages is limited to 250 chars and just takes the first 250 chars of the log4j message. The 'full_message' contains the full log4j text.
